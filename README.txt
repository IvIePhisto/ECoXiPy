ECoXiPy - Easy Creation of XML in Python
========================================

This Python 2 and 3 project (tested with CPython 2.7 and 3.3 as well as PyPy
2) allows for easy creation of XML. The hierarchical structure of XML is easy
to spot and the code to create XML is much shorter than using SAX, DOM or
similar APIs. There is also functionality to efficiently validate and transform
XML while it is being created.
